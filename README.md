Requirements, use cases, business processes, business rules, data dictionary, and data models.


## Requirements
Requirements are simple statements about what a system must do. Often there are better ways to define a requirement, but you have to start somewhere. For example, requirements related to data are usually better described in a data model; interactions may be better defined in a BPMN model; etc.

Each requirement has the following:
1. A unique identifier or number
2. A title, or short description
3. An explanation
4. A category to group like or related requirements
5. A ranking to indicate relevant importance
6. The feature that the requirment belongs to


## Use Cases
A use case corresponds to a set of behaviours that the system may perform in interaction with its actors, and which produces an observable result that contribute to its goals. Actors represent the role that human users or other systems have in the interaction.

1. The name of the use case, which is the goal the actor wants to achieve in the system
2. The actor who uses the use case
3. A textual description of the use case as an overview 
4. The data that is required as input
5. Data produced as output
6. The steps that are generally followed in accomplishing the use case
7. Any exception path that might be followed
